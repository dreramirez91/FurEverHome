Today we received our repo and discussed the remaining items that we needed to collectively decide upon. After adding those as well as our tasks into our Trello, set up our repo. Then, we decided to focus on the JWTDown exploration to be ready to go for auth first thing tomorrow. No blockers.

Today we completed auth, tomorrow we will decide if we want to personalize right away or come back if there is time, then continue work on the backend. No blockers.

Today we discussed some backend goals for the week and decided we will focus solely on meeting requirements before adding on any personalization or stretch goals. We continued working on the backend, focusing on our dogs pydantic model and getting data into the database. We ran into some issues with the foreign key and were able to solve a few but still have some errors as blockers. Happy Birthday Dre!

Last night I researched our errors a bit and informed the team via slack. This morning we ran through the code, successfully fixed the errors, and pushed. Starting the day with no blockers. We are continuing work on the backend today

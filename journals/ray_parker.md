First day with the repository and we organized our thoughts on our trello board. Today we focused on API endpoints and watching the JWTdown FastApi video. We decided on going with PostgreSQL for our database and to begin coding authentication tomorrow. Overall we're more than prepared and I feel confident in our ability to work as a team. We plan on taking turns every thirty minutes to code for the back end. Once we get to the front end we will go into pairs and work on feature branches. We agreed on using the Gong method to annouce pushing and pulling, hoping to minimize merge conflicts and stay up-to-date with the code.

We successfully completed our backend without personalized data, following along Curtis' video and taking turns coding. The wireframe, api design and journals have been added to the repository. Our database is set up and we are connected to both fastapi and react. We are on schedule and did a great job communicating throughout our first day coding.

Our next goal is to finish setting up the tables for our database and creating queries and routers for each. We ran into an issue with connecting the account_id to the rehomer_id. We had to individually delete our tables in the database and pull in the new tables to fix this. We are still looking into why it may not be connecting. On a positive note, we were able to add the DuplicateAccountError HTTPException to the create account function resulting in a 400 if that were to occur.

We're almost finished with our backend. We made progress as a team on the CRUD operations for the dog table in the routers and queries. There were a few erors we ran into and were able to fix most. Update dog is still a work in progress.

We are taking the day to catch up on explorations since we are at a good stopping point. Summer break will be from July 3-7.

The front-end has a good template for a home, app, nav, signup, and login. Tomorrow we will start front-end authentication. Currently we're ahead of schedule and brainstorming what we need to accomplish next.

## July 11, 2023
Front-end authentication is finished. We decided to continue using react and not go with redux. Tomorrow we plan on working in teams to develop the list view and create dog view.

## July 12, 2023
Right now we're dealing with a blocker in logging in and signing up without duplicates. We will spend time researching this tonight and continue to mob code in the front end. Our goal is to start the list dogs dogs and create dog today.

## July 13, 2023
We need to go back to the back-end to add to the dog table. We are going to add email to the dog card so users are able to contact the owner. After we update the table finishing the create dog and list dog page is the next priority.

## July 14, 2023
We're almost done coding out the front-end. What's left is the my dogs page and the delete feature. The delete and edit functionality will be added as buttons to the my dogs page. That is our goal for today, if need be we'll finish up monday before starting any customization.

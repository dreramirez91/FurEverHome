We worked on setting up Trello to be used in lieu of Gitlab issue board. Tonight, we will finish the authentication video. No blockers.

Day 2 - 6/26

Last night I spent about 4 hours studying authentication in SQL and encountered some errors I have yet to resolve. Today our team will attack authentication as a unit.

Day 1 - 6/26

We worked on setting up Trello to be used in lieu of Gitlab issue board. Tonight, we will finish the authentication video. No blockers.

Day 2 - 6/27

Last night I spent about 4 hours studying authentication in SQL and encountered some errors I have yet to resolve. Today our team will attack authentication as a unit.

Day 3 - 6/28

Yesterday, our team finished backend authentication except for the duplicate error class. Today, we plan on tackling that as well as as many API endpoints as we can. No blockers.
